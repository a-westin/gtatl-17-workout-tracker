# Fitness Tracker

## Description  

  This full-stack app is a fitness tracker that allows users to create a new workout plan by adding exercises, adding new exercices to an existing workout plan, and view the stats of their workouts on the dashboard. The app utilizes a MongoDB database and was deployed using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.

  ### Usage
  
  Run 'node server.js' to begin the application, then go to localhost:3000 to view the app locally. Alternatively, visit the deployed application [here.](https://afw-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/)
  
 New users will need to begin by creating a new workout and adding as many cardio and/or resistance exercises they desire. From there, users may either create a new workout or add exercises to an existing one. Clicking on the "dashboard" in the nav bar brings the user to their "stats" page, which provides detailed information about the various workout plans.
